    <p id="tribute-info">Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a
      fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as President
      of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.</p>
    <p id="p1" class="text-center"> Here's a time line of Nelson Mandela's life:</p>

  <ul>
       <li>1943-49 Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand</li>
       <li>1950-54 Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950,[70] and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL.</li>
       <li>1955-61 After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and
         white minority rule</li>
       <li>1961-62 Disguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike</li>
       <li>1962-64 Imprisonment Arrest and Rivonia trial.</li>
       <li>1964-82 Robben Island.Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell
         measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by 7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep</li>
       <li>1982-88 Pollsmoor Prison.In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated
         to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island</li>
       <li>1988-90 Recovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the dank conditions in his cell, in December 1988 Mandela was moved to Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. He was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and used the
         time to complete his LLB degree. While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo.Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds
         and the press; the event was broadcast live across the world. Driven to Cape Town's City Hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but made it clear that the ANC's armed struggle
         was not over, and would continue as "a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid". He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that "there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle", and insisted
         that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in national and local elections. Staying at Tutu's home, in the following days Mandela met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated
         100,000 people at Johannesburg's Soccer City.</li>
      </ul>
